"""Serve the page's cards and load them into the frontend.

The CTC EcoZenith page uses two cards of its own (www/ctc-ecozenith-card.js), which
add an explanation to every value. They are served by the integration and added as a
Lovelace resource the way the NIBE and Miele integrations add theirs: best effort on
storage mode resources, with the version in the address so a browser picks up a new
card after an update, and exactly one entry of ours kept. Where resources are managed
in configuration.yaml nothing can be added from here, and the script is injected into
the frontend instead.

A browser that already has Home Assistant open loads resources once per page load, so
after an update the page has to be reloaded once before the new card is used.
